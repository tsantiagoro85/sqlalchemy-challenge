# sqlalchemy-challenge

In the present challenge, Python and SQLAlchemy are used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database.
The present repository contains a folder called 'SurfsUp', which in turn contains a file called 'climate_starter.ipynb', which perfoms data analysis of the datasets contains in the folder 'Resources'. 
In addition, the repo contains a Flask API (app.py) based on the queries developed.
